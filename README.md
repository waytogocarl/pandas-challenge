School District Performance Analysis

We are analyzing school performance in this district based on a variety of factors, such as school type, size, and budget. 
We take a deeper look at the passing testing scores (scoers over 70%) in reading and math specifically, and what are the overall passing rates in these subjects. 
We analyzed these scores by comparing them to the school's size, type, their total budget and also the budget per student.
From these analyzations we were able to look at the highest-performing schools, and the bottom performing schools based on the % of students who passed math, reading, and the overall passing rates.
As we moved further into our analysis we then began to compare scores in math and reading based by grade, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th from all the schools in the distrcit.
We then looked at how much each school spends on any given individual student and compared those amounts to the average math and reading scores of those students.
We did the same with school sizes, and school types.

One conclusion I can draw from this analysis is that on average students at Charter schools appear to have higher math scores and reading scores as well as having a much higher overall passing rate among students. 
We can conclude that more kids are passing their math and reading scores in Charter Schools in this district, we can assume that something in the style of curriculum or teaching methods, or the way charter schools are run is more successful due to their higher overall rate of passing students.
Another conclusion we can make is that small-medium sized schools have a higher overall passing rate as well as higher rates of students passing math and reading.
We could assume that it is due to the teachers having smaller classroom sizes and therefore having a better handle on the classroom or being able to spend more individual time with the students.
